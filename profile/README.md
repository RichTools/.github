# RichTools
I aim to build the mojority of the tools I use from scratch, so that I can understand how they work.
That way I can have my own little unique tool set of different things. 

## Future Plans Including but not limited to:
- A Programming Language and Compiler
- A Browser
- I want to redo RichUI
