# RichTools
I aim to build the mojority of the tools I use from scratch, so that I can understand how they work.
That way I can have my own little unique tool set of different things. 

## Why reinvent the wheel you ask?
Because it helps you learn and understand the tools you use on a day to day basis. Also it's just interesting see the design decisions your favourite tools made.

## Future Plans Including but not limited to:
- A Programming Language and Compiler
- Neural Net ML Library
- Testing Library
- A Browser
- I want to redo RichUI
